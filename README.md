## A collection of chrome extensions that I normally use to scrape dae from websites.

I started this project initially with a couple of things in mind.
1. Learn about chrome web extensions
2. Scrape data of financial instruments (basicall stocks) that I personally own and use that as input to my study in portfolio construction.

### Installation
I use the unpacked version of the codebase to install the extension. To do this, just drag and drop the yahoo-finance-scraper folder into the chrome://extensions/ page. And voila. That's all you need to do. In future if I feel like I've added more feature that might be of help to others, I'll probably package it and upload it to the chrome web store. But till then, chill.
